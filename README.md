# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Development
A hands-on data analytics project focused on collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to uncover trends and patterns. Includes KPI definition, data preprocessing, visualization, and dashboard creation to present insights clearly and support data-driven decision-making using real-world datasets.

Process Steps
1. Data Collection

* Gathered datasets from multiple sources (CSV / Excel files)
* Reviewed data structure, columns, and data types
* Understood the business context of the data

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
